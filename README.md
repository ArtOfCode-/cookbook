Cookbook - Recipes from the margins.
====

Often times when cooking or baking, we scour the internet (and physical books) for recipes, and end up making
something that draws from mulitple sources.  Sadly, when we find something that we like, it's hard to recall _which_
sources contributed to what we'd made previous.

This is a small website to index and track the recipes that we actually made.
